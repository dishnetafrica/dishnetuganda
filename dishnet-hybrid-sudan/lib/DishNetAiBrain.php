/**
 * DishNetAiBrain — the conversational brain, running inside the plugin.
 *
 * Prompt architecture is ported from ShopBot's AiBrain (app/Services/Bot/AiBrain.php).
 * What was worth taking was never the Laravel code — it was the discipline:
 * ground every commercial claim in retrieved data, never accept a price the
 * customer proposes, advise on the need rather than wait to be told a product
 * name, and emit machine-readable markers when the conversation should cause
 * something to happen.
 *
 * CONTRACT — deliberately identical to the HTTP endpoint in
 * workers/AiReplyWorker::askShopBot(). Same envelope in, same shape out:
 *
 *   reply(array $context): ['reply' => string, 'escalate' => bool, 'escalate_reason' => string]
 *
 * That is what keeps Option B reachable. If the plugin runtime is ever
 * outgrown, the brain moves to its own service and the worker changes one
 * config value — no redesign, no tool rewrites.
 *
 * Provider-agnostic: reuses the plugin's existing ai_provider / claude_api_key /
 * openai_api_key configuration, so nothing new needs configuring.
 *
 * PHP 7.4 compatible. Pure curl.
