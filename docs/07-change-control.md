# Change control

The UISP/uCRM installation is treated as production infrastructure that happens
to share a host with EasyPanel. This page is the standing rule set.

## The one way this setup gets broken

The whole arrangement depends on one fact: **UISP was installed with
non-default ports (8080/8443), so Traefik can hold 80/443.**

Re-running the UISP installer without the original port flags would make UISP
try to bind 80 and 443. Traefik already holds them, so UISP fails to start, and
depending on ordering after a reboot the two can fight over the ports. That is
the single most likely cause of a serious outage here.

So:

- **Use `unms-cli update` to update UISP.** It preserves the configured ports.
- **Never re-run the UISP install script** as a way of fixing a problem.
- Before any UISP maintenance, record the current ports from `unms.conf` (the
  inspection report captures them) so they can be re-supplied if an install
  ever genuinely becomes necessary.

## Standing rules

Per your instruction, and with the reason each one exists:

| Rule | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Do not install or recreate UISP inside EasyPanel | EasyPanel would own the container lifecycle; a panel upgrade could then take the network offline |
| Do not update UISP containers through EasyPanel or `docker pull` | UISP updates involve database migrations that `unms-cli update` sequences correctly and an image swap does not |
| Do not move UISP behind EasyPanel for device traffic | Device connectivity would inherit Traefik's uptime. Browser UI through Traefik is fine — see `05` |
| Do not replace or reinstall the existing UISP | Above |
| Use EasyPanel for everything *except* UISP | That is what it is good at |

## Procedure for any change

1. **Establish the baseline.** `sudo ./scripts/verify-uisp-health.sh` — save it.
2. **Snapshot.** `sudo ./scripts/backup-configs.sh`, plus a UISP backup from the
   UI if the change touches UISP at all.
3. **Write it down first**, in the five-part form below.
4. **Apply one change.** Not three.
5. **Verify.** `verify-uisp-health.sh` again, plus a real device check if
   anything touched ports, DNS or the UISP hostname.
6. **Commit** the documentation change to this repo, so the repo stays an
   accurate record of the server.

If step 5 does not match step 1, roll back. Do not investigate forward from a
degraded state on a live network.

## The five-part form

Every change gets these written down before it is applied:

1. **What is currently configured** — observed, from the inspection report.
2. **Why the change is necessary** — the problem, not the solution.
3. **Exactly what will change** — files, ports, settings, commands, verbatim.
4. **Effect on UISP/uCRM** — including "none", with the reasoning for why none.
5. **Rollback** — the specific steps, and how long they take.

[05-domain-and-tls-plan.md](05-domain-and-tls-plan.md) is written in this form
as a worked example.

## Change log

| Date | Change | Applied by | Rollback | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | Repo created: inspection tooling and plans. No server changes. | Claude | n/a | Documentation only |
| 2026-09-14 | Sent-folder archive routed to `stalwart` with verification off (`set_sent_copy.php --host stalwart --hosts ''`). Workaround for Stalwart's placeholder certificate. See [09](09-mail-and-pdf-delivery.md). | Bhavin | `--host mail.dishnetuganda.com --hosts stalwart`, seconds | Applied, verified by `--test` |
| 2026-09-14 | `crm_public_url` written into `kyc_config.json` so `webhook.php` can see it, moving quotation PDF URLs off `:8443`. Workaround for the webhook's single-source config read. See [09](09-mail-and-pdf-delivery.md). | Bhavin | `saveOverrides(..., ['crm_public_url' => ''])`, seconds | Confirmed by a real send 15 Sep; **retired** later that day once 5.17.0 fixed the root cause — the duplicate was cleared and the value lives only in `config.json` |
| 2026-09-15 | Plugin 5.17.0 uploaded via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. `webhook.php` now overlays `PluginConfig::load()` onto the store copy (root cause of the 14 Sep PDF fault); quotation emails write a `customer_email_log` row with sender; `SentCopy` distinguishes TLS failure from unreachability. Code in `059acf9`; record in [09](09-mail-and-pdf-delivery.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.16.0 ZIP (retained from 14 Sep), minutes | Applied; verified `grep -c "+ PluginConfig::load" webhook.php` = 1 in the container |
| 2026-09-15 | Plugin 5.18.0 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. Quotation PDF links are signed and checked only by the daily-rotating token (`lib/QuotePdfToken.php`: today and yesterday, UTC); `serve_quote_pdf` no longer accepts the permanent `.meta` token and serves `.pdf` files only; failed-queue retries re-sign a stale link; `tools/notify_doctor.php` reports whether `webhook_secret` is set in the store. Receipt, delivery-note and temporary-invoice links unchanged. Code in `4d432be`; record in [09](09-mail-and-pdf-delivery.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.17.0 ZIP (retained from 15 Sep), minutes | Applied 15 Sep; verified in the container: `grep -c "QuotePdfToken::verify" includes/api/api_cron_debug.php` = 1, `manifest.json` at 5.18.0. `notify_doctor` then reported `quote PDF link secret: DEFAULT` — `webhook_secret` is unset in the store, so quotation links are signed with the published default. **Open**, see [09](09-mail-and-pdf-delivery.md). |
| 2026-09-15 | Plugin 5.18.1 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. Quotation PDF links sign with a key of their own, `quote_pdf_secret`, generated once into the store copy of `kyc_config.json` at the first plugin page load, direct webhook hit or quote-cron run that finds none; `webhook_secret` is left alone (it also derives the customer-app JWT key and acts as the `debug_key` bearer). `notify_doctor` line now three-state. Code in `822ffc2`; record in [09](09-mail-and-pdf-delivery.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.0 ZIP (retained from 15 Sep), minutes; links then fall back to the shared secret or default as before | Applied 15 Sep; verified in the container: `manifest.json` at 5.18.1; the key was generated by running the plugin's own `QuotePdfToken::ensureSecret()` from the CLI before any plugin page had loaded; `notify_doctor` then read `set — quote_pdf_secret in the store, shared with nothing else`; the live `serve_quote_pdf` endpoint answered 200 to a link signed with the new key and 403 to one signed with the old default |
| 2026-09-15 | Plugin 5.18.2 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. Settings → "Setup Webhook", the `webhook_register` debug action and `tools/webhook_setup.php` now share one policy (`lib/WebhookRegistrar.php`): create for every event at an address uCRM can reach, otherwise repair only what is wrong; never narrow the event list, never replace a reachable address, never touch `webhook_secret`. The Settings tab judges the route and shows an events tile. Code in `87e00ca`; record in [09](09-mail-and-pdf-delivery.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.1 ZIP (retained from 15 Sep), minutes | **Pending upload**; verify: Settings → Webhook tab shows "Route OK" and "Events OK" for the existing endpoint, and pressing "Setup Webhook" reports that nothing changed |
| 2026-09-15 | Plugin 5.18.3 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. The sales assistant now sees a prospect's own recent conversation (`unknown` identity replays its own epoch, 14-day floor; customers' turns still never reach it) and carries a prospect-selling posture: answer price requests first, treat a typed name/company/email as progress, acknowledge a colleague named or a call referred to, escalate, never impersonate. Lead records carry the email. Worker logs `identity=… history=…` per turn. Code in `b5bcbcc`; record in [10](10-ai-sales-prospects.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.2 ZIP (retained from 15 Sep), minutes | Applied 15 Sep; `manifest.json` at 5.18.3 verified in the container; all four assistant switches on, human cooldown 30 min. Behaviour to be confirmed on the next prospect conversation: the log shows `history=` rising turn by turn and the replies build on the thread |
| 2026-09-15 | Plugin 5.18.4 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. A customer created in billing mid-conversation keeps the prospect thread (previous `unknown` epoch carried forward, 14-day window, one direction only); an identified customer with no live service gets a sign-up posture instead of service mode; `NotificationService::send()` sends the caller's text or nothing (no more "EVENT CLIENT ADD" dumps; hand-created clients get a real welcome); knowledge seed `PLAN_SERVICE_MAP` rewritten to use live plan names. Code in `8c8deb0`; record in [10](10-ai-sales-prospects.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.3 ZIP, minutes | Applied 15 Sep. `seed_knowledge.php --refresh-seeded` in the container reported `corrected: PLAN_SERVICE_MAP` (0 added, 34 present, 1 corrected), which also confirms the 5.18.4 files are the ones installed. Behaviour to be confirmed on the next prospect who is created in billing mid-conversation |
| 2026-09-15 | Plugin 5.18.5 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. A uCRM product named like a monthly plan (the two plan mirrors in the Products tab, used for quotation lines) is dropped from the assistant's one-time HARDWARE list, so a plan is never presented as a one-off or added into a connection total; the drop is logged. Code in `1aa3822`; record in [10](10-ai-sales-prospects.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.4 ZIP, minutes | **Applied via 5.18.6, 15 Sep 2026.** Verified: the catalogue listing shows HARDWARE as the two kits and the installation only; both plan mirrors gone |
| 2026-09-15 | Plugin 5.18.6 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. The invoice e-mail now carries the invoice: the `invoice.add` webhook fetches uCRM's invoice PDF once and hands the same bytes to the WhatsApp document and to the e-mail as `Invoice-<number>.pdf`; it passes the plan and service period the template actually reads (the first wiring passed a key the template ignored), greets by first name and writes the due date out; the template says "PDF attached" only when one is, and the same rule now governs the quotation e-mail on all three of its senders. Plain-text parts of every template list no fact they do not have (the receipt printed "Service period:" with nothing after it). Includes 5.18.5. Code in `ab27406`; record in [09](09-mail-and-pdf-delivery.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.4 ZIP, minutes | **Applied 15 Sep 2026.** Verified: manifest reads 5.18.6 (grep count 1); catalogue listing clean. The invoice switch was turned on the same day (`--on invoice`), so quotation, payment receipt and invoice now e-mail customers; uCRM's own Mailer / Notifications pages still unchecked in the browser. Still to observe: the first real invoice landing in `customer_email_log` as `invoice · sent` with `Invoice-<number>.pdf` in the mailbox |
| 2026-09-15 | Plugin 5.18.7 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. The five lifecycle e-mails not yet switched on (welcome, service paused, service resumed, installation scheduled, support received) are wired to print their facts: each had passed the template keys it does not read, two subjects would have gone out half-written, and two fired on events that do not mean what the e-mail says. Now: service facts from uCRM's own records in its own offset; the paused e-mail names the unpaid invoice and amount and offers the configured pay link; a pause is remembered per service so `service.activate` sends the resumption after a pause and the welcome for a first activation, claiming a payment only when one was seen; installation e-mails need an installation title, a date and a client; support acknowledgements need a client. Code in `199b421`; record in [09](09-mail-and-pdf-delivery.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.6 ZIP, minutes | **Applied 15 Sep 2026.** Verified: manifest reads 5.18.7 (grep count 1) and the switch tool shows the new "fires when" texts. All eight lifecycle e-mails switched on the same day. Still to observe: the first real welcome, paused, resumed, installation and support sends in `customer_email_log`; uCRM's own Mailer / Notifications pages still unchecked in the browser |
| 2026-09-15 | Plugin 5.18.8 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. `tools/set_customer_emails.php --all-off` cleared every e-mail switch but displayed all eight still ON: the dispatcher's disk snapshot was a one-shot static filled by the "Before" display. The snapshot now follows the files, and the tool compares what it reads back with what it was asked, printing FAILED and exiting non-zero when something else (data/config.json) still supplies a value. New `tools/wa_lifecycle_test.php`: every customer WhatsApp message the notification service composes, with invented data, to one number, between a TEST header and footer, with `--dry-run` and `--only`. Code in `1661531`; record in [09](09-mail-and-pdf-delivery.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.7 ZIP, minutes | **Applied 15 Sep 2026.** Verified: manifest reads 5.18.8 (grep count 1); `--show` reported the true state (all eight OFF since the earlier `--all-off`); all eight switched back on in one command with a truthful read-back. `email_lifecycle_test.php`: 9 of 9 [TEST] e-mails sent and filed in Sent Items. `wa_lifecycle_test.php`: header, 10 samples and footer all delivered (HTTP 200) to the operator's number |
| 2026-09-15 | Plugin 5.18.9 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. The WhatsApp assistant stays awake: the WhatsApp Business app's greeting (a text our side sent word for word to 3+ other conversations in 7 days) is stored as `WhatsApp auto-reply` and never stands the AI down — it had done so in 49 conversations in a week; a question arriving during a colleague's pause is parked (`EventBus::defer()`, attempts untouched) and answered when the pause ends unless a person answered it, dropped after `wa_parked_max_minutes` (120); photo, document and flyer sends claim and record their Evolution id like the text reply; stored UTC stamps are read as UTC on both worker clocks (`lib/UtcClock.php`) in the hand-over check, the watchdog and the queue's retry times; a message whose five retries fail pages the team and sends the customer the hand-over line; `tools/wa_clock_repair.php` corrects the 36 notification rows stamped three hours ahead. Code in `c8e3ab6`; record in [17](17-whatsapp-bot-availability.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.8 ZIP, minutes | **Applied 16 Sep 2026.** Verified: manifest reads 5.18.9 (grep count 1). `wa_clock_repair.php` reported 41 rows in 18 conversations, all written by the notification record (`DishNet Plugin`), confirming the diagnosis; `--fix` repaired 41, remaining 0. Log baseline at install: `human active, skipping AI` 208 (must not grow); the four replacement lines 0. Still to do by the operator: switch off the WhatsApp Business Greeting/Away messages on both numbers; set `wa_human_cooldown_minutes` deliberately (5–30); confirm `ai_handover_message` is set |
| 2026-09-16 | Plugin 5.18.10 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. A prospect on the support number was quoted a kit, an installation, a total and two monthly plans, none of them in uCRM: that number was never handed the catalogue (fetched for sales only), nothing in its prompt said the list was missing, and `ReplyPrivacyGuard` — which refuses money the tools did not return — was wired into the old WASender webhook and never into the Evolution worker. Now the catalogue loads on support and account whenever `ai_sales_on_all_numbers` is on; the PLANS/HARDWARE absence fences appear on every channel; the guard runs on every reply the worker sends, permitting catalogue prices, sums of one-time items, whole-month plan multiples, the customer's own words and figures already in the prompt — anything else with money on it is replaced by the safe fallback, handed over and recorded as metadata. Code in `0e39c4f`; record in [18](18-prices-come-from-ucrm.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.9 ZIP, minutes | **Applied 16 Sep 2026.** Verified: manifest reads 5.18.10 (grep count 1). Baseline at install: 0 blocks, 0 support-channel turns with the catalogue (no support message had arrived since the upload). `build.json` is absent on this install by design — the stamp ships from 5.18.11. Still to observe: the first support-channel turn showing `catalogue loaded`; `ai_security_events.json` for any block with a legitimate reply behind it |
| 2026-09-16 | Plugin 5.18.11 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. Accessories shop, part 1: `tools/shop_products_sync.php` creates the twenty accessories in uCRM Products by exact name (report first; `--apply --prices-include-tax`; tax copied from the kit; never edits an existing product); `assets/shop/catalogue.json` holds content and photos and no price; `public.php?page=shop` lists kits and accessories at uCRM prices through the price feed's cache with an Order-on-WhatsApp button, `?page=shop_img` serves sized WebP photos by slug; the assistant gets accessories under an ACCESSORIES heading apart from the kit and installation, and a `ai_fact_prices` business fact for the VAT statement; the price guard permits kit + installation + one or two accessories. First ZIP carrying `build.json`. Code in this commit; record in [20](20-accessories-shop-part-1.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.10 ZIP, minutes; delete the twenty products in uCRM if they must go | **Applied 16 Sep 2026.** Manifest 5.18.11 verified. The sync tool's report was right (5 uCRM products, 20 to create, kit spelling `Starlink Mini Kit`), but `--apply` created nothing: uCRM refused every product with 422 because the payload carried a `description` field the product record does not have. `set_config.php` refused `ai_fact_prices` as unmanaged. Both corrected in 5.18.12 below |
| 2026-09-16 | Plugin 5.18.12 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. Corrects two things the 5.18.11 live run showed: the sync tool sends only uCRM's product fields (`name`, `unit`, `price`, `taxable`, `taxId` copied from the kit; no `description`), prints the exact product names uCRM holds, and the fake uCRM in the tests now refuses unknown fields like the real one; `tools/set_config.php` manages `ai_fact_prices`. Nothing else changes. Code in this commit; record in [20](20-accessories-shop-part-1.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.11 ZIP, minutes; the twenty products, once created, are deleted in uCRM Products if they must go | **Applied 16 Sep 2026.** `build.json` confirms commit `3a33735` on disk (the 5.18.11 attempt had not been uploaded; the stamp is what proved it). Sync: `created 20 · failed 0`, uCRM product ids 8–27. `ai_fact_prices` set to "All our listed prices include VAT." The report names the five pre-existing products: `Starlink Mini Kit`, `Starlink Standard Kit`, `Professional Installation`, `Residential (up to 400 Mbps)`, `Residential Lite (up to 100 Mbps)` — both kit spellings match the shop catalogue, so both kit cards will show. **Open question for the operator:** `Starlink Mini Kit` is `taxable: no` in uCRM, so the twenty accessories copied that. Prices are therefore final as listed and no invoice line carries VAT — consistent with the kits, but a question for the accountant if these supplies are VAT-taxable. Still to observe: the shop page at `?page=shop`, and two test chats on the sales number |
| 2026-09-16 | Plugin 5.18.13 + website. **Regression fixed:** creating the twenty accessories put them into the public price feed's `hardware` list, which `starlink-kits.html` renders as kit cards — the live kits page showed twenty mounts and cables as Starlink kits, each promising delivery, installation and a first month. The feed now returns `plans`, `hardware` (kits and installation) and `accessories` (with photo slugs), and drops products that are really plan mirrors; `prices.js` limits the kits grid to kits. **New:** `dishnetuganda.com/shop.html` with `assets/js/shop.js` rendering the live catalogue, a Shop link in the desktop and mobile nav on all 36 pages, a sitemap entry, and the fallback card if the feed is unreachable. `verify-site.sh` PASSES (57 pages, 0 broken references, no price published in the repository). Code in this commit; record in [21](21-shop-on-the-website.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.12 ZIP; redeploy the website container | **Plugin applied 16 Sep 2026.** Manifest 5.18.13 verified. Feed confirmed after clearing the price cache: `hardware` 3 (`Professional Installation`, `Starlink Mini Kit`, `Starlink Standard Kit`) and `accessories` 20 — the kits page renders kits again and the plan mirrors are gone from both one-time lists. **Website deployed 16 Sep 2026** and confirmed working by the operator: `dishnetuganda.com/shop.html` is live with the Shop tab in the navigation. Note for the next website change: the shop work sits on `claude/study-this-jhe2eg`, which was 93 commits ahead of `main` at the time — whatever branch the EasyPanel app builds from must carry it |
| 2026-09-17 | Plugin 5.18.14 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. A customer ready to buy asked which number to pay to at 00:59 and was refused: that is the South Sudan default of the `ai_fact_payment` business fact ("NEVER share bank details"), and the key could not be set from anywhere — nor could `ai_fact_office` or `ai_fact_delivery`, so Ugandan customers are still told the office is in Juba and kits cross at the Joda border. All three are now managed by `tools/set_config.php`, with a warning when a payment text carries an account number and when an office or delivery text names a South Sudan place. A set payment fact is quoted verbatim by the assistant (never reformatted), because `ReplyPrivacyGuard` permits only figures the prompt contains: the configured account is sent, any other is blocked with the safe fallback and a hand-over. Prompt corpus unchanged. Code in this commit; record in [22](22-payment-details-in-chat.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.13 ZIP; clear the setting with `--clear` to return to the refusal | **Applied 17 Sep 2026.** `ai_fact_office` (Acacia Mall, Kampala) and `ai_fact_delivery` (the team delivers and installs) set correctly. `ai_fact_payment` was set from the example command in this record **with its `<BANK>` / `<NUMBER>` placeholders still in it**, so for a few hours the assistant was ready to tell a customer to pay into "account <NUMBER>" — a worse answer than the refusal it replaced, and my fault for publishing a runnable command that was really a template. Corrected the same day with the real Ecobank UGX account, and 5.18.15 below makes the tool refuse the template |
| 2026-09-17 | Plugin 5.18.15 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. `tools/set_config.php` refuses any value still carrying an angle-bracketed placeholder (`<BANK>`, `<NUMBER>`, `<TILL>`) and saves nothing, naming the placeholder it found and offering `--clear` as the way back. It exists because the 5.18.14 example command was pasted verbatim into live config: a deploy note that can be run is run, so the tool now has to catch what the notes cannot. Checked before any write, on every key, not just the payment fact. Nothing else changes; prompt corpus unchanged. Code in this commit; record in [22](22-payment-details-in-chat.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.14 ZIP, minutes; the refusal is a check, not a stored setting, so nothing is left behind | Pending upload. After upload, a value containing `<` + capitals is refused with "nothing was saved" and the previous value stands |
| 2026-09-17 | Plugin 5.18.16 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. **The payment fact could not actually be delivered.** The prompt orders it repeated character for character; `ReplyPrivacyGuard`'s leak rule discards any 45-character run of the prompt echoed back in a reply — so the more exactly the assistant answered "which account do I pay into?", the more certainly the reply was replaced by the safe fallback and handed to a person. The same applied to the office and delivery facts. Found by testing the live configured value against the brain's real prompt. `DishNetAiBrain::operatorText()` now returns the business facts the operator actually set, and both reply paths pass them to the guard as `public`: a prompt sentence that came from the operator's own text is an answer, not a leak. Built-in defaults are never quotable (they carry instructions), nor are the sentences the plugin wraps around the operator's text. Swept over every one of the 115 qualifying sentences of the real prompt: 3 operator sentences sent, 112 of ours still refused. Prompt corpus unchanged. Code in this commit; record in [22](22-payment-details-in-chat.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.15 ZIP, minutes; or `--clear` the payment fact, which returns to the refusal | Pending upload. After upload, the live check is one message on the sales number asking where to pay: the reply must carry the account number, and `ai_security_events.json` must gain no `system_prompt` block behind it |
| 2026-09-17 | Plugin 5.18.17 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. **A customer was sent the `<<LEAD {...}>>` marker**, their own name and location as JSON, on the end of an otherwise good reply: the model closed the marker with one angle bracket instead of two, every pattern required two, so nothing was stripped — and the sales lead was never recorded either. The LEAD JSON is now walked brace by brace (strings and escapes respected, so a `}` or `>` in a value cannot end it early) and however many closing brackets the model wrote, including none, are consumed; unterminated JSON is cut rather than displayed; `ESCALATE`, `QUOTE`, `FLYER`, `PHOTO` and `DOC` accept one bracket and still act on their intent; and a net underneath removes any run opening with `<<` that names one of our six markers, matching those names only. Prompt corpus unchanged. Code in this commit; record in [23](23-the-marker-that-reached-a-customer.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.16 ZIP, minutes | Pending upload. The lead from that conversation was lost and is not recoverable from the queue — it is in the WhatsApp thread only, so it needs entering by hand if it is still wanted |
| 2026-09-18 | Plugin 5.18.18 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. **Phase 1 of 3 — location.** A customer answering "which area?" with a WhatsApp location pin got no reply at all: `evoExtractText()` knew eight message shapes and `locationMessage` was not one, so the text came out empty and the queue step dropped the message; the coordinates were never read out of the payload. New `lib/WaLocation.php` parses a pin, refuses `0,0` and anything off the globe, and keeps but flags a pin outside the deployment country (derived from `timezone`, overridable with `geo_country`); `WaLocation::mergeText()` gives the AI something to answer so the message is queued; migration 072 stores `location_lat`/`location_lng` on `wa_messages` and the inbox body shows the coordinates; the worker attaches the conversation's most recent pin to the lead it writes, while a coordinate the MODEL supplies can never be written (not in `FIELDS`); the assistant is told it has no map and must not name a town, estimate distance, or judge coverage. `storeMessage()` builds its insert from the columns the database has, so a migration that has not run cannot stop the inbox. Prompt corpus unchanged. Code in this commit; record in [24](24-location-pins.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.17 ZIP, minutes; migration 072 only adds columns and is not reversed by a downgrade | Pending upload. After upload, send a location pin to the sales number from a phone not in the CRM: the reply must acknowledge it, and `grep 'location pin' ` the AI log should show `in area` |
| 2026-09-18 | Plugin 5.18.20 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. **Phase 2 of 3 — the AI lead reaches uCRM.** Qualified leads have been written to `leads.json` since 5.18.3 and nothing ever carried them into uCRM. New `lib/UcrmLeadSync.php` creates them as lead clients (`isLead: true`) through the existing `CrmApiClient` and the payload `cron/kyc_crm_sync.php` already uses, driven by a new `crm.lead.sync` event and `workers/UcrmLeadWorker.php` so a customer never waits on uCRM for their reply. Idempotent four ways: an existing `crm_client_id` patches, a known phone links, two clients on one number REFUSE and flag for a person, and a create happens once under a lock that re-reads the lead. `organizationId`/`countryId` are read off the clients this install has (overridable with `ucrm_lead_organization_id` / `ucrm_lead_country_id`), never copied from the KYC literals. Coordinates go on as `gpsLat`/`gpsLon` and the patch rewrites nothing else. A uCRM outage is distinguished from an empty result, so an unreachable CRM is retried rather than read as "nobody has this number". **Ships OFF** — set `ai_crm_lead_sync` to enable. Prompt corpus unchanged. Code in this commit; record in [25](25-ai-lead-into-ucrm.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.18 ZIP, or set `ai_crm_lead_sync --clear` which stops all uCRM writes immediately | Pending upload. `tools/org_probe.php` was run on 18 Sep before release: **one organization, id 1 DishNet Africa Limited, all 47 of 47 sampled clients on it**, so the run-time derivation returns 1 and no config is needed — and the KYC literal `organizationId => 2` is wrong for this install. The probe also showed the country lives on the organization (247) rather than on clients, so 5.18.20 consults the organization when the clients are silent, and refuses where two organizations and no clients make it a guess |
| 2026-09-18 | Plugin 5.18.21 built for upload via uCRM → Settings → Plugins. **The operator's business facts were never in the prompt on this install.** `DishNetAiBrain::coverageRules()` was an if/else and `localFacts()` had its only call site inside the `else`; with 34 knowledge entries seeded (confirmed by a read-only query on the live box) that branch never runs, so `ai_fact_payment` (the Ecobank account), `ai_fact_office`, `ai_fact_delivery`, `ai_fact_prices` and `ai_fact_location_pin` all reached nothing — and 5.18.14/15/16 were written against a dead path. The payment refusal came from the knowledge rule `RULE_PAYMENT_SAFETY` ("details on the invoice"), not from the `ai_fact_payment` default; doc 22 is corrected. `businessFactsBlock()` is now called from both branches, the knowledge-base branch taking operator-SET facts only so South Sudan defaults cannot leak into a Uganda prompt. Legacy path byte-identical. **Prompt corpus deliberately changed** `ba05b3dd` → `f770081e`. Code in this commit; record in [26](26-operator-facts-vs-knowledge-base.md). | Bhavin | Re-upload the 5.18.20 ZIP, minutes; no data or config is touched by this change | Pending upload. **This alone will not make the assistant give out the bank account** — `RULE_PAYMENT_SAFETY` still tells it to use the invoice. That reword is proposed separately and awaits approval |

## 5.18.22 — the customer who picks Business 50 themselves

**18 September 2026** · `lib/DishNetAiBrain.php` (`qualification()`),
`tests/test_plan_recommendation.php` (new), `tests/test_ai_qualification.php`

A real conversation on 18 September: home, ten people, asked the price. The
assistant recommended Residential and did it well — that path was never broken.
The broken path is the other one. Every rule in `qualification()` governs what
the assistant RECOMMENDS; none of them covered a customer who arrives having
already chosen. "How much is Business 50?" matched nothing, so it was simply
quoted — and Business 50 is the cheapest line on the list, the number reads as a
speed, and a 50 GB priority block is gone in days on a busy household.

Changed:

- **Self-selected Business plans.** When the customer names one, asks its price
  or says it looks cheaper, the consequence is stated BEFORE any price: the tier
  numbers are priority data, not speeds; after the block the line drops to about
  1 Mbps until more data is bought. Then the higher-capacity Residential plan is
  recommended. If they still want Business, it is quoted without argument — they
  have been told, and it is their money.
- **The 1 Mbps figure**, confirmed by the operator. `BUSINESS_PLANS` in the
  knowledge base says "behaves like standard data", which is true and persuades
  nobody. *(The knowledge-base entry itself is unchanged and awaits approval.)*
- **The higher-capacity Residential plan is now the default answer**, not merely
  preferred — operator decision.
- **The Mini is the kit led with**, as the lower upfront total. The rule that no
  plan requires a particular kit survives unchanged.
- **The Business steer is reversed**: where a remote-access requirement is real,
  the assistant still leads with Residential. It must never claim remote access
  works on it — the public IP is named as a separate quotation and the
  conversation is handed over. Selling the plan is a commercial choice; claiming
  a capability CGNAT does not provide is the assistant inventing network
  availability.

Tests: 159 files green, 0 failures. `test_ai_qualification.php` lost two
assertions pinning the old Business steer; they were replaced, not deleted, so
the protection moved rather than disappearing.

## 5.18.23 — the follow-up evaluator asks which provider this install uses

**18 September 2026** · `lib/FollowUpEvaluator.php`, `cron/followup_run.php`,
`tools/set_config.php`, `tests/test_followup_provider.php` (new)

`cron/followup_run.php` read `claude_api_key`, and only that, then built a
`ClaudeWaClient` with it. The Uganda install runs `ai_provider=openai`, so the
key was empty, the script returned at its guard on every run, and the only
trace was one `error_log` line. Confirmed four independent ways: 2,300 log
occurrences over ~5.3 days matching the queue's age, `DONE followup_run in
14ms` where a real evaluation takes seconds, the explicit message, and
`sales_stage = 'unknown'` on all 264 open rows — a column written only after
the evaluator returns.

`followup_scan` needs no key (SQL only), so it kept opening rows. 261
follow-ups accumulated and not one draft was ever written.

Changed:

- **`FollowUpEvaluator::clientFor()`** — provider selection as a function a test
  can call, because the four lines it replaces lived in a cron script with no
  seam, which is why nothing caught them for five days. Every other
  provider-consuming site in the plugin already branched on `ai_provider`;
  this was the only one that did not.
- **The error names the provider.** `no API key` told nobody which of two keys
  to set.
- **`followup_run_limit` registered in `set_config.php`.** It was read at
  `followup_run.php:47` but never registered, so the per-run evaluation limit
  could not be turned down. At the default 5, a 257-row backlog is seven hours
  of drafting.

Not changed, deliberately: sending. `followup_send.php` still sends only drafts
a person approved, and `followup_run.php` still has no path to Evolution. A test
asserts both, so fixing evaluation cannot quietly turn the engine into an
autoresponder.

The two clients are not interchangeable in general — `ClaudeWaClient::getReply()`
takes a seventh `$tools` argument `GptWaClient` does not have. They are
interchangeable here because `evaluate()` passes six, and a test pins that.

Tests: 160 files green, 0 failures. A mutation reinstating the original bug
fails 8 assertions.

## 5.18.24 — WhatsApp enquiry follow-ups may send themselves

**19 September 2026** · `lib/FollowUpPolicy.php`, `cron/followup_run.php`,
`tools/set_config.php`, `tests/test_followup_auto_send.php` (new)

Operator decision: WhatsApp is one-to-one, the message is short, and it goes
to somebody who wrote to us first about something they asked. Email keeps its
own policy and is unchanged.

`FollowUpPolicy::mayAutoSend()` — four conditions, all required:

1. `followup_auto_send` is on. **Absent means off**, so an install that
   upgrades into this behaves exactly as it did the day before.
2. The assistant returned `SEND`. `WAIT`, `DO_NOT_SEND` and
   `ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN` never auto-send.
3. There is a message. An empty body is a bug, not a send.
4. The content level is `CONTENT_ENQUIRY`. **`CONTENT_ACCOUNT` still waits for
   a person** — provenance good enough to ANSWER a balance question is not
   provenance good enough to SEND somebody an unread message about their
   money. A wrong identity wastes a message in the first case and puts another
   customer's balance on a stranger's phone in the second.

Plus: the drafted BODY is scanned for escalation words. The customer's own
words already close the follow-up at gate 6, so no draft can exist for those;
this is the other direction — the assistant writing about a refund.

**Auto-send approves a draft. It does not send one.** `followup_send.php`
still delivers, and still re-checks opt-out, human takeover, a reply arriving
and the sending window between approval and delivery. Routing through
`approve()` rather than around it is what keeps those four protections on the
automatic path, and leaves `decided_by = 'auto'` in the trail. A test asserts
`followup_run.php` still has no way to reach Evolution at all.

Email untouched and asserted: `EmailReplyPolicy::NEVER_AUTO` still holds back
13 categories unconditionally, and `followup_auto_send` does not unlock any of
them.

Tests: 161 files green, 0 failures. Mutations removing the account gate or the
master switch each fail 3 assertions.

**Not enabled.** `followup_auto_send` is unset. Do not switch it on until at
least ten drafts have been read — no draft has ever been produced on this
install, so there is no evidence yet about their quality, and 257 open
follow-ups against a cap of 30/day is nine days of unread messages.

## 5.18.28 — KYC customers reach uCRM

**25 September 2026** · `lib/UcrmClientTarget.php` (new), `lib/KycCrmSync.php`
(new), `lib/EfrisClientField.php` (new), `lib/KycService.php`,
`lib/EfrisInvoiceMapper.php`, `cron/kyc_crm_sync.php`,
`includes/post/post_kyc.php`, `tabs/sales/applications.php`, `main.php`,
`includes/api/api_crm_misc.php`, `tests/test_kyc_crm_create.php` (new),
`tests/fixtures/fake_ucrm_kyc.php` (new). Full record:
[30](30-kyc-customers-not-reaching-ucrm.md).

Every customer registered through the staff app's KYC wizard was saved in the
plugin and refused by uCRM with `404 Not Found`: the create named organization
2 and custom fields 36–43, none of which exist on this uCRM, and custom field 1
— which it sent as *Sales Person* — is the EFRIS TIN here. The agent was told
"Customer saved!", Orders counted the customer "In CRM ✓", and the retry job
had never run. Three applications (12–24 September) were waiting.

The organization and custom fields are now checked against the connected uCRM
before the create: organization 2 where it exists, else the only one, else
refuse; the nine fields only where all nine exist and none is a tax field.
This install gets organization 1 and no custom fields; the South Sudan layout
gets a byte-identical request. The retry job works (claim, fit, a same-phone
check that stops for a person, create, then what the form would have done),
a refused create is shown in amber with uCRM's reason, Orders counts from the
uCRM id, and an admin can retry from Orders.

Tests: 112 assertions in the new file; 29 weakened copies each caught by
counted failures; full suite 186 files green twice.

**Applied by:** the operator, with `deploy-hybrid.sh`.
**Rollback:** `git checkout <the commit --check reported>` and deploy again;
clients already created in uCRM stay.
**Status:** pending deploy. Before deploying, check the three waiting customers
were not typed into uCRM by hand. After it, they arrive under Leads within ten
minutes, or stop on Orders for a person to check.
